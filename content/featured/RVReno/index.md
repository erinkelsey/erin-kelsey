During the pandemic, I was locked down like the rest of the world, unable to be a nomad. I needed a project to keep myself busy, so I decided on renovating an RV. With a few power tools (and a lot of help from family and friends), I was able to transform a boring old Class C Motorhome into a modern, bright and comfortable tiny home, which I now reside in full-time.
