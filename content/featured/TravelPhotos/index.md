Being a digital nomad has afforded me the opportunity to travel around the world, and visit many beautiful locations. In order to commemorate being in each of these locations, I always take a few photos. As with everything in life, I always strive to create the best product possible, which is why I became proficient in photo editing with Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop. These skills are also beneficial to my professional work as a software engineer, and for any design work I undertake.
