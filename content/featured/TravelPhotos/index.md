Being a digital nomad has afforded me the opportunity to travel to many wonderful and beautiful places around the world. In order to commemorate being in each of these locations, I always take a few photos. Why have bad travel photos, when you can have amazing ones? Which is why I decided to become proficient in photo editing with Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop. These skills are also beneficial to my professional work as a software engineer, and for any design work I undertake.
